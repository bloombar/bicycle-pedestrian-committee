# Village of Croton-on-Hudson Bicycle & Pedestrian Committee
We serve as advisors to the village on matters of interest to bicyclists and pedestrians.

## Project board
We track the progress of issues and ideas discussed by the committee and the village using a [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)-style board.

## Research
Research and strategies for improving safety for bicyclists and pedestrians in general, not necessarily specifically related to our village, are collaboratively developed into a wiki.
