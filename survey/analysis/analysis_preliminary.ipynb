       "49     Walking in Croton is fine when I have time and there are sidewalks.  I feel that biking is too dangerous on any highly traveled roads, I prefer bike in rural areas like the Croton Reservoir and designated biking trails.

       "62     I'm happy to walk to things that are close to my home, I do it a lot. But sometimes things are spread out, and there are some big hills (up Maple from the lower village, for example) and big roads (9a) that are less appealing for walking. Also a lot of times it's very dark in certain places, which makes me feel unsafe when walking after dark in the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "187    I find Croton to be a very walkable area.  During school I find the five corners area very dangerous for both walkers and cyclists due to drivers not fully stopping even when the crossing guard is holding up his stop sign.

       "189    Mostly it's fine, there are areas where you need to walk in the road especially with strollers due to the state of the sidewalk or overgrowth.

       "200    Walking is fine for pleasure. Great if your within proximity to stores etc.. Biking: Streets are now too congested with traffic and parked vehicles. Roads are just as narrow as ever. The biking community is competitively small and should get by with what exists. Don’t let spending on biking become another skatepark. If people wanted to live in a more bike friendly area they would have moved there. We don’t have the money or street space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "214    I love to walk or bike more, and I wish the main shopping areas (upper village/van wyck/Harmon) were more connected in a way that avoids riding on the main road. I feel the main roads are swamped by too-fast traffic and the roads are very narrow because of street parking. Something like the bike path around Half Moon Bay that helps bicyclists commute safely to the train station would be amazing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "229    I commute to the train station by bike and I feel fine. But I’m used to riding in NYC traffic—Croton is a cakewalk. I have noticed the Croton drivers are unused to bikers: Croton streets are narrow and Croton drivers do not expect to share them. I don’t think there’s a fix for that, though—it’s just the reality road bikers deal with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "284    Not as safe as I should, people speed in cars, do not respect crosswalks, speed up when dummy light is yellow.  Dummy light works fine, drivers do not, very difficult for pedestrians there.  Drivers speed through light not paying attention to pedestrians who have right of way.  Can cameras be placed at dummy light and grand street and other problem areas?  This would help with safety and be a well deserved revenue source for the village.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "285    On trails, amazing for the most part, though drainage is a concern especially after minor rainstorms and erosion on certain trails (most notably the connection between the Audbun Trails and the Croton Harmon Trails (section is between the Golf Course and Power Lines to Buchanan). As for the roadways, especially on N Riverside, there are no marked crosswalks for pedestrians, and doubly so when crossing NY-9A. It is especially concerning when running that one day, turning right on Bank Street, I might run someone over making the turn onto the sidewalk there, never mind turning left onto the intersection in a vehicle. A mirror (minimum) would greatly enhance visibility at this intersection for cars (so they won't have accidents with pedestrians or other cars when making left turns) and for pedestrians (who can then see danger). Traffic calming is perhaps the best way to fix this issue, along with updated community maps in Open Street Map (see below).                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "335    Good, but only at the Landing or on trails. Walking on the sidewalk anywhere in the Village is risky — there is no enforcement by police of speed limits, stop sign laws, or pedestrian right-of-way, and poorly trained school crossing guards make walking in the village potentially DEADLY for children, and dangerous for adults.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "336    I like walking with my family, but cars go very fast and it can be quite scary to go about half a  block to the nearest sidewalk (which does not exist on my block). There are also many sidewalks in dire need of repair and many overgrown trees/shrubs that block the path in places. The sidewalk doesn't exist in certain areas (like in front of my own home) and is only on one side of the street. It switches, forcing unnecessary street crossings on a road where cars drive too fast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "414     Croton Landing & the Riverwalk are amazing locations to see and walk or bike. Clearly there was lots of time and money spent on making these locations enjoyable for all. The issue is the pathways to walk there are visually unappealing specifically Brook Street & Riverside Ave. The area is neglected. Sidewalks are narrow, crumbling and dirty. The street is a two way street for cars but with cars parked on the street, only one car can pass at a time. There are numerous incidents of “road rage” and dangerous driving on the street making it unpleasant and unsafe for people to walk down. Brook Street is the pathway people use to get to the Riverwalk if they are coming from the upper village towards Riverside Ave. and then using the overpass. To make the pathway more attractive to visitors and residents it needs to be cleaned up. It would be great if there were signs from town showing how pedestrians could get to the overpass and Riverwalk area. If the street were more appealing and user friendly, I could see people walking from a restaurant or shop in town down to the riverfront. \n",

       "465    Happy in along the lovely river parks but scared approaching the intersection to town or Shoprite from the train station.  We bike or walk constantly for fun and errands, and the pedestrian or bike approach to Shoprite is absolutely unacceptable with my toddler along.  Horrible, and no one can expect us to go the safer very long way.  The CVS plaza needs a pedestrian and bike approach to the A&S plaza.  Again awfully out of the way to walk it, and the businesses are losing my money since it is difficult to take a toddler in and out of a car seat for such a short run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

People drive too fast through there, there should be a speed bump or something.  I drop / pick my kid from happy hearts and it always dangerous there.  The dummy light works best as a regular traffic light, not a blinker, but there should be no parking allowed in the intersection, such as in front of the liquor store and in front of orangeberry, and in front of the Chinese restaurant. These parking spots obscure pedestrians entering the intersection. Also, Rotaries are dumb idea.

       "505    Great within the parks. Roads feel dangerous on a bike. Especially 129. I would really love to ride to town with my son. But it's too dangerous.

       "1      Yes.  Croton Point Ave.  Some sections of Cleveland have bushes sticking out onto the sidewalk that leave little room for pedestrians.

       "127    Croton Point avenue is a disgrace to 20th century safety concerns let alone the 21st century.  The fact that the village does nothing to fix it shows how little it values its own citizens particularly the commuters who are an important part of the community even if they can't come out and complain as much as the small minority who want Croton to never change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "128    Potholes all over the village, poor visibility at intersections because people don’t trim their hedges, lack of space on sidewalks for pedestrians because of overgrowth of bushes, tree roots lifting up sidewalks, better upkeep of village spaces with mowing, cutting weeds, particularly at Benedict Circle, hill on Riverside, Municipal Place. DOW site at Municipal Place is an eyesore. Get rid of it. If I was thinking of moving to Croton and saw the lack of upkeep in this town, esp. with our tax rate, I wouldn’t move here.

       "158    Young Avenue from 5pm to 7pm, drivers drive too aggressive to avoid traffic at the stop light at Riverside and Croton Point and Riverside and Benedict.  All times of day, drivers drive way too fast in both directions of Benedict, especially in South-East direction which is downhill. There should be a stop sign at Benedict and Young in both directions of Benedict, and one at Benedict and Penfield in both directions of Benedict. The crosswalks at the train station parking lot and Rte 9 exit ramp should have a stop sign that requires cars to stop if pedestrians are in the crosswalk. It is very common at busy crosswalks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "192    Young Avenue from 5pm to 7pm, drivers drive too aggressive to avoid traffic at the stop light at Riverside and Croton Point and Riverside and Benedict.  All times of day, drivers drive way too fast in both directions of Benedict, especially in South-East direction which is downhill. There should be a stop sign at Benedict and Young in both directions of Benedict, and one at Benedict and Penfield in both directions of Benedict. The crosswalks at the train station parking lot and Rte 9 exit ramp should have a stop sign that requires cars to stop if pedestrians are in the crosswalk.

Pedestrians have to walk on the road which is dangerous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "214    Some sidewalks are not as smooth or maintained between Harmon and Van Wyck on S Riverside. Also, N Riverside near the Jeep dealership. This area is often slippery in the winter as well. It would be really nice to have stairs or a ramp from Riverside down into the ShopRite plaza as well. I often see people stepping over the road barrier and shuffling down that steep hill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "216    Benedict Blvd, tree has overtaken the sidewalk causing it to be pulled up and is a dangerous tripping hazard , tree should be removed.  Many people walk the sidewalk daily to go to the train.  Also the tree drops a ton of acorns in the fall I have to be careful on my own driveway that I don’t slip on them, the sidewalk gets the same debris.  I like trees but there should be better cultivar there that will not cause accidents and sidewalk damage for those that do walk on the sidewalk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "222    Crosswalk across Maple from Wells to Van cortlandt. Many people walk from Wells to Van Wyck shopping area but there’s no cross walk or safety signs. Also, why doesnt the lower speed limit on Maple from Albany Post Rd end at Olcott and not extend all the way to Wells?

       "229    There are potholes by Croton Auto Park.\\n\\nIf you’re considering adding bike lanes, then I’d recommend adding them near Croton Auto Park (so that bikers can safely ride under 9 to Senasqua) and under 9 enroute to the train station.\\n\\nIs there anyway to beautify the 9 bridge near the train station? Maybe a local artist could paint a mural on the bridge. As it is, it just looks industrial... A visitor from the city once asked me, “Does Croton have a town?” We see a lot of tourist traffic under that bridge (e.g., when the Blaze starts up during Halloween). (I know that asking to beautify something sounds like a loosey-goosey request from a Crotonite with too much time on their hands... But I don’t fit that stereotype. I genuinely think that this might be a good idea—at least something to consider.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Croton Point Ave is a nightmarish hellscape, and bike lanes and traffic lights are going to do almost nothing to change that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "237    Croton Point Ave is a disaster for cars, pedestrians and cyclists. The train parking lot is also unsafe for pedestrians.

       "285    The entire village's sidewalks could use at least an inspection, and several sidewalks need immediate replacement. Van Wyck-Riverside Walking connection is recommended to reduce the need for car traffic in that area from local residents (and encourage walking to the connection), and maps of the surrounding trail systems (with GPS precision) NEED to be created on platforms (i.e. Open Street Map) and maintained, as this would greatly improve availability and navigability of Croton on trail systems and bike paths. This includes the Briarcliff-Peekskill Trailway sections in town, Croton Trails Network, etc. Similarly, OSM data needs updating to better reflect what buildings are in the area (especially businesses) as it helps update apps that use the data (Pokémon Go, Ingress, etc.) to encourage people to walk around town in the first place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "333    No sidewalks on cemetery side of Cleveland, just before the library. Also, missing sidewalks on Cleveland North of Loconto/Hughes. This is dangerous, especially being so close to the elementary school.\\n\\nAs for biking (to the train station), this pretty much feels dangerous to/from ANY direction. There are a decent number of bike commuters, and they all inevitably end up on Cleveland/Benedict, S Riverside Ave, and Croton Point Ave... the same roads that all cars/trucks end up on too. No part of this feels safe, especially during the morning/evening rush when drivers are racing (literally) to make the next train or get out of the Croton lot and home. It's pure luck that more bikers and pedestrians aren't hurt.\\n\\nSpecifically, for bikers, there are no bike lines and lots of debris on the sides of the roads that can cause bike damage and for bikers to skid/lose control.\\n\\nFor pedestrians, the crosswalk into the train station doesn't feel safe either. (Maybe only when the crossing guard is there in the morning.) While traffic FROM Croton Point Park usually yields to pedestrians, it's a total gamble/guessing game if traffic from the opposite direction (from 9) will do the same. Drivers to Croton Point Park will speed around the turning lane into the train station, or worse, use the turning lane as a through lane.\\n\\nLane markings and crosswalks needed repainting years ago, and new signage/lights would go a long way here. Perhaps the crossing guard isn't even necessary if you had a traffic light that could stop traffic (24/7), as needed, with the press of a push-to-walk button?\n",
       "335    Lack of sidewalks and lack of respect for pedestrian right-of-way on signed crosswalks throughout the village, particularly on routes to CET and PVC, makes walking to school unsafe for our children. Lack of sidewalks and street lighting, lack of respect for pedestrian right-of-way, general disregard for safety, and utter lack of police monitoring of traffic at train station makes walking along Croton Point Avenue dangerous. I live close enough to walk and I’m afraid I’ll be hit by a car on CPA—not worth the risk to me, especially after dark, so I am forced to drive. Cleveland Drive is a main route to CET/PVA for walking students, and the sidewalks are uneven, poorly maintained, and often overgrown with shrubbery — and the speed of traffic adjacent makes me terrified to allow my kids to walk to the Library or the Upper Village. The crossing guard at the Five Corners could benefit from training and overall safety at that perilous intersection might improve if he was permitted to manage traffic flow at peak hours, or if he was replaced by an actual police officer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "336    Old Post Road North is in bad shape in many areas. Where the sidewalk exists, it is uneven, cracked, and a tripping hazard, in addition to having a large amount of overgrowth. It is also not handicapped-accessible, making it difficult to use with a stroller, let alone for someone with a disability. Corners should be ramps for accessibility and sidewalks are in need of replacement/repair. Sidewalks are also narrow in many areas, and limited, forcing people to cross the busy/fast road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "414    My son was hit by a truck while walking in a crosswalk by Saint August Church in Croton while walking home. Drivers often drive through the crosswalk there because the area is not well lit at night. Even during the day that specific crosswalk is extremely dangerous. Many cars do not fully stop at the stop sign and drive into the crosswalk.

       "420    Harmon area leading to the train station needs a drastic overhaul to increase safety for all. There are bus stops with no dedicated safety measures for pedestrians. No bike lanes so you have to weave through dangerous traffic. No lights to ensure pedestrians have ample time to cross the streets. Too many speeding cars or cars illegally parked causing backups and aggressive driving. It’s a mess and I love to walk to the train station without having to worry about getting hit by a car on a daily basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

I encourage this committee to find a way for residents to submit issue areas and improvement ideas on a continuing basis.    \\n\\nThere are a dozen ways to do it but a simple email address and a prompt like, \"the transportation committee wants to hear from you. \\nPost a picture or send us an idea of an improvement....\" Something like  that belongs in every Village newsletter/email.\\n\\nI LOVE the folks at Dept Public Works, but I strongly believe that this question is in the sweet spot of a committee like this.\\n\\nCroton is already a high ranking place to live.

(I have no mobility issues that would cause me to fall for reasons besides the uneven surfaces.) Also, shrubs that line 129 need to be cut back for a) visibility and b) to give the bicyclists some of the road.  It's already so dangerous to bike on 129...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "435    The intersection of Benedict Ave, Cleveland drive and Truesdale is very dangerous. Coming into that traffic circle cars from all directions have no stop signs or speedbumps, only need to yieid as they enter the circle, which often means not slowing down much at all. I have to cross that intersection daily with my toddler daughter as she attends circle school. Many small children and their parents or grandparents need to cross that intersection multiple times daily, and there is no crosswalk anywhere near that area. Cars coming down from Cleveland are navigating a curve with reduced visibility, and coming down hill, often speeding, just as they enter the school area. It is very dangerous for pedestrians trying to cross as well as those trying to strap in or out their children from car seats parked on that road. At the very least, they area should have a reduced school zone speed limit, possibly a stop sign or speed bump. We also need crosswalks to be able to get from Benedict to the side of Cleveland that Circle School is on. A little while back our police were observed serving speeding summonses to many drivers on that exact stretch one morning, and that was a very welcome site.

       "458    There are some residents who do not have sidewalks for example on Franklin Ave. There are many residents whose sidewalks are to dangerous to walk on so you are forced to walk in the street, Park Avenue and on Truesdale. This makes no sense. There is no sidewalk on the Oneida side of the new Maracas Restaurant. We need a sidewalk when you exit the train station, you should not have to cross the street to walk on a sidewalk. We need sidewalks on all the streets that are used by children to walk to school safely like on Van Cortlandt Place by the CVS shopping plaza. There needs to be a sidewalk on the opposite side of the Capriccio 1 plaza on Maple so you can walk safely to the Chase Bank plaza. And a sidewalk on South Riverside across from the Duck Pond.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

We were side swiped on maple in our car. Car that hit us didn’t even stop. What’s the villages response?? Maple is a highway.- maybe we will but a speed meter. Did they????

The sidewalk down by van Cortlandt manor is ridiculous I’ve never seen it being used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "496    The area under the overpass next to Croton-Harmon station. I found it ridiculous that to stay on the sidewalk, visitors to The Blaze had to cross the street from the station. But I know that area is being redeveloped--I haven't paid that much attention to what it will look like in the future. It'd also make sense for there to be a sidewalk from Riverside to the shopping center where ShopRite is. I've noticed some ShopRite employees don't have cars and end up having to scoot along the guardrail to get to the bus or train station. I'm not sure if that's a Village concern, however, or the property owner's.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "497    There in area in the center of the village - a mid-block crossing at Old Post Rd S in front of Asbury United Methodist Church that could most definitely use a fresh coat of paint, and a pedestrian sign on each side. It’s a highly trafficked area with several childcare facilities, a church and the nearby high school. With high foot traffic and the fact I’ve been crossing this stretch for 8+ years on practically a daily basis and it’s about a 50% chance a car will slow and yield to pedestrians. I'm told it's not considered a village crosswalk, yet there is paint on the road that looks like it was put there by a municipality.

       "509    Croton Point Avenue is extremely UNpedestrian friendly. It is poorly lit and does not have adequate sidewalks. We often walk to and from the train station, but I do not feel safe or comfortable while doing so, especially at night. I find this shocking, given the number of commuters and I really wish something would be done about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "268    My biggest concern is about crossing guards who stop traffic against the light to let kids cross the street.  It worries me that the kids are learning that it’s okay to cross against the light and just assume traffic will stop for them.  Then there’s the frustration of the drivers who are held up even though the light is with them.  Kids need to know The rules of the road and how to cross safely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "422    A best practice is to have a Village bike and ped master plan.  The plan should set goals for miles of new class I, II and III bike lanes,  carefully create and monitor safe routes to school, provide safe bikable shoulders so we can bike to all the awesome trails in the township, study redevelopment areas and create development guidelines. For example, so building facades can be brought back to the street and parking can be tucked behind, etc. (Hey, this begs the question where are COH's zoning codes regarding bikes, peds, parking, mixed use, etc? When were they updated last?  Why not hire some New Urbanists like Duany, Platter and Zyback to bring us up to speed?)\\n\\nThis committee should study up on bike and ped master plans.  It is fun and inspiring to read a stack of other community's plans.  Talking to the firms who help create them is also informative.  In a nutshell, they are typically the result of ongoing public processes and input from professional engineers and planners.  They rarely have teeth when it comes to implementation or $ but they do provide something to generate support for and track progress of administrations against.\n",

       "128    Leaf collection in fall either needs to be bagged or more frequent vacuuming. When wet, very hazardous to drive, huge piles leads to lack of parking spaces on side streets and also more cars parking further out into the roadway(where you would drive). The huge piles of leaves also makes it difficult to walk on sidewalks as they fall onto the part you’d walk on. Very difficult for a baby carriage or wheelchair to get through and I worry about the elderly slipping and falling. Also, after a snowfall, crosswalks and corners on side streets are rarely shoveled, again, impossible for the elderly, baby strollers or the handicapped to get across.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "335    We need pedestrian lanes (i.e., functional and safe sidewalks) just as much as we need bike lanes in Croton.

       "410    Croton is hilly.   Winter is cold. It rains 50 inches per year.  These natural obstacles will always keep riding down.  Thus, big $$ projects are probably mostly a waste of $$.

       "428    At the train station, I'd like to see a sidewalk between the fence and the Preferred parking area, similar to the new one at Senasqua Park, so pedestrians don't have to worry about being hit by a car pulling out of those spaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "435    I personally believe bike lanes to be a bad idea. Besides the expense, bicyclists often don't follow the rules, laws and lanes intended specifically to keep them safe. If you want to encourage more bike traffic in the village (which I think is a bad idea) you also need to increase your ability and your will to enforce safety laws on the bicyclists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

They have  aright to be there, but so do drivers, we should make it safe for both.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "519    For the Croton Point Avenue (CPA) project, the easiest approach to safety is to separate the cyclists from the car / bus traffic completely.  Build a tunnel under the parking lot of Shop Rite that drops them off to a more safe spot at the train station.\\n\\nSame idea with pedestrian traffic of the train commuters.  Build an overpass from the main parking lot to the other lot across the street.\\n\\nAlso, build out / change the road infrastructure of U.S. Route 9 to have an egress that leads cars directly to the train station parking lot instead of them integrating into the regular town traffic on CPA.\\n\\nThe Croton train station is our biggest asset.  If we want it to be used and known as a major train station hub, then let's treat it like one and give it the adequate infrastructure needs such as these 2 suggestions above.  Also, while super expensive, building a parking garage to house more commuters and provide a overpass from the train station to the garage / parking lot would yield a safer, and more better quality of life in commuting and bring about more revenue in parking permits.\\n\\nAlso, on a separate location, add a right turn lane on Riverside Avenue, where possible.\n",

       "285    I have several suggestions to improve the village, and a good way to determine the problem locations includes accurate maps available to the community as a whole (OpenStreetMap is perfect for this application, as it now provides all sorts of data to be included) and also helps to determine who would most be potentially impacted by such changes. Finally, it greatly improves the trail mapping potential (allowing village residents better ability to use trails as an extra form of egress around the village). Finally, the Van Wyck-S Riverside connection is perhaps a good way to reduce traffic load near N Riverside, as it encourages walking for residents on the dead end streets, and reduces the load on the parking area in the Croton Landing Area.\n",

       "305    1. The title is pretty blown-up. If it was to generate interest, I think it back-fired. I'd prefer a more serious approach. \\n2. No mention of buses or the possibility of a shuttle to the train.\\n3. The emphasis seems to be on biking which I don't think is reasonable in Croton. The village is too hilly,  the streets mostly too narrow for bike lanes, the climate too inclement much of the year.  Put the effort and money into other more reasonable and pressing needs. \\n4. Please take heed of the increasing number of bicyclist deaths in New York City. Would you want a death to be a result of encouraging more biking?                                                                                                                                  \n",

This is possibly a greater threat to pedestrians, most of which are school children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "519    The goal is to build/ amend infrastructure to enable not just safer, but more efficient travel, using less gas (environment) and still allowing for our small town enjoyment.  If we want to build up Croton for more business revenue (also property tax revenue) and for more business transactions to take place (versus travelling to Mohegan Lake for Walmart, Mt. Kisco for Target) in town, then let's design our transportation paths to stay on the perimeter of town.  The parking garage would be helpful for that.  People could park there and take an underpass to the stores in the Shop Rite shopping center and/or walk to the other businesses in the Harmon area.                                                                                         \n",
