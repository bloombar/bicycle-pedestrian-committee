Notes from the village board of trustees' discussion about volunteer committees publishing their own social media pages.

volunteer fire department:
* fire department has page that gets rave reviews
* pugh advocates allowing them to keep it
* they are an independent entity
* pugh thinks they are different to other committees
* but perhaps should follow any social media policy of the village

pugh advocates
* allowing one person to post
* thinks it's silly for committees to have their own pages
* a lot of effort to very little gain... difficult to build audience
* only one person from committee would be allowed to post
* ultimate control of page would rest with village designee
* could give someone at the police department post abilities on village page, rather than allow them their own 

village manager king
* worries that message on committee pages may differ from official village message
* wants to remove bike/ped and CAC committee pages
* says anyone can have page, as long as it's not village endorsed
* thinks that volunteers should understand they represent the village

gray haired trustee and horowitz think committees can just request their messages to be posted to village page
