# Overview

---

## GitHub
GitHub.com is a web-based suite of project management tools, recently acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion.  

Its primary audience is software developers.

---

## Features
GitHub includes many features that are important to projects of any type:
- [Wikis](#wikis) - a quick way to collaborate and publish documents
- [Task boards](#task-boards) - a tool to track progress on projects
- [Document storage and archiving](#storage) - maintaining a history of changes and enforcing accountability

---

## Pricing
GitHub is free to use for public "open source" projects, and paid for private projects.

---

## Open Source -> Open Government
Maintaining public visibility into a municipal project not only allows one to use GitHub for free...  

Open access also promotes transparency, citizen engagement, and trust in government, ideals of the [Open Government](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1shCAfXCGFKm4Jx8MalzzznV5UsQiAjD2ULBg2Qtduxc/edit?usp=sharing) movement.

# Wikis

---

## Concept
A wiki is a collaborative knowledge base - a set of documents, co-written by multiple authors, published online.

Wikipedia is undoubtedly the world's largest and most popular wiki.  There are other many companies that make wiki software, besides GitHub and Wikipedia/MediaWiki.

---

## Emphasis on speed
Wikis are intended to be faster and simpler to work with than other web publishing tools.

"wiki" definition from [Hawaiian->English dictionary](https://glosbe.com/haw/en/wiki):

> verb
>
> to be swift, speedy, quick

---

## Advantages
A wiki is a great tool for documenting collective knowledge:
- **web publishing** - easy to publish online
- **multiple authors** - anyone can edit (if given permission)
- **accountability** - it's easy to see who changed what
- **accessibility** - available anywhere, anytime, to anyone
- **centralized knowledge base** - serves as a central repository of knowledge (unlike myriad easy-to-lose Google Docs and emails)

Imagine if Wikipedia was a set of public Google Docs instead of a wiki.

---

## Disadvantages
A wiki has its own limitations for knowledge management:
- **learning curve** - there's a small learning curve to using them effectively
- **images** - adding images to a wiki takes more work than simply dragging-and-dropping
- **potential messiness** - with multiple authors, there is a risk of inconsistent styles (true of any type of shared document)
- **content maintenance** keeping content up-to-date requires effort (true of any type of long-living doc)

# Markdown

---

name: markdown-concept

## Concept
Wiki documents are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

Markdown is a simple, standardized way to write documents, including formatting like...
- document headings and subheadings
- bullet-pointed or numbered lists
- links to other documents

Markdown is easy and very widely used for web publishing of simple documents.

---

## Example

The [previous slide](#markdown-concept) (and all other slides here) was **quickly** written in Markdown:
```markdown
## Concept
Wiki documents are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

Markdown is a simple way to write well-formatted documents, including things like...
- document headings and subheadings
- bullet-pointed or numbered lists
- links to other documents
```

---

## Headings and Sub-Headings

This code in Markdown:
```markdown
# Some Kind of Heading
```

... becomes:

# Some Kind of Heading

While this code:
```markdown
## A sub-heading
```

... becomes:

## A sub-heading

---

## Bold and Italicized Text

This code:
```markdown
It's a **wonderful** evening!
```

... becomes:

It's a **wonderful** evening!

While this code:
```markdown
It's a _wonderful_ evening!
```
... becomes:

It's a _wonderful_ evening!

---

## Bullet Point Lists

This code:
```markdown
- first item
- second item
- third item
```

... becomes:

- first item
- second item
- third item

---

## Numbered Lists

This code:
```markdown
1. first item
2. second item
3. third item
```

... becomes:

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

---

## Links

This code:
```markdown
[Click me to go to the New York Times](http://nytimes.com)
```

... becomes:

[Click me to go to the New York Times](http://nytimes.com)

---

## Images

This code:
```markdown
![Sigmund Freud](https://croton-on-hudson.github.io/bicycle-pedestrian-committee/images/presentations/github_training/sigmund_freud.jpg)
```

... becomes:
![Sigmund Freud](https://croton-on-hudson.github.io/bicycle-pedestrian-committee/images/presentations/github_training/sigmund_freud.jpg)

---

## That's all!

Now you pretty much know Markdown.  

You are ready to publish web pages using a wiki.

# Task Boards

---

## Concept
Task boards are used to keep track of the status of each task necessary for a project to be completed.

Many companies offer similar task board software to GitHub, including [Trello](https://trello.com/) and [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).

---

## Status
On a simple task board, every task is placed in one of a few columns:
1. To do
2. In progress
3. Done

---

## Example
For example, here is a simple [task board for this workshop](https://github.com/croton-on-hudson/github-training-workshop/projects/1).  It's very clear what is already done, and what is left to do.

---

name: label-tasks

## Tagging tasks
Each task can be given a custom label.  This makes it easy to find all tasks with a common label.

![task labels](../images/presentations/github_training/task_board_concept_labels.png)

Note that in order to label tasks, you must first click the "..." icon in the top-right of the task and click "Convert to issue".

---

## Assigning responsibility
Each task can be assigned to a particular individual.  This way everyone knows who is supposed to do what and whether they finished it or not.

![task labels](../images/presentations/github_training/task_board_concept_assignment.png)

---

## Filtering tasks
It's easy to show only tasks with a particular label, or only tasks assigned to a particular individual.  This becomes especially helpful when there are many tasks on the board.

![filter tasks](../images/presentations/github_training/task_board_concept_filter.png)

---

## Changing status
When a task's status changes, simply drag-and-drop it to a new column.

# Document Storage and Archiving

---

## Concept
GitHub can store files of any kind.
- Written documents (preferably written in Markdown)
- Images
- Videos
- Maps
- ... and more

All changes to files are recorded and old versions are automatically archived.

---

## Images and other media
Images of any type can be easily stored in GitHub.  The same is true of videos and audio files.

This can be useful for documenting known street issues, or for saving inspirational photos of other municipalities.

---

## Maps
GitHub provides special support for a common type of map file called GeoJSON.

For example, the Bicycle Pedestrian Committee recently shared with the village [a GeoJSON map showing suggested placement of speed humps and sharrows along Elliott Way](https://github.com/croton-on-hudson/bicycle-pedestrian-committee/blob/master/maps/eliott_way.geojson).

---

## Computer Programming Code Files
GitHub is especially good at storing and archiving files with computer programming code.

You may think this is irrelevant... but not if you write [lots of code to automatically analyze responses to a survey of 561 local residents](https://github.com/croton-on-hudson/bicycle-pedestrian-committee/tree/master/survey)!
