# Overview

---

## GitHub
GitHub.com is a web-based suite of project management tools, recently acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion.  

Its primary audience is software developers.

---

## Features
GitHub includes many features that are important to projects of any type:
- [Wikis](#wikis) - a quick way to collaborate and publish documents
- [Task boards](#task-boards) - a tool to track progress on projects
- [Document storage and archiving](#storage) - file storage and change history

---

## Terminology
GitHub falls prey to a bit of software industry jargon.

A **repository** in GitHub parlance is simply a collection of:
- a wiki (just one)
- task boards (as many as you want)
- document storage and archiving (as many files as you want)

---

## Pricing
GitHub is free to use for public "open source" projects, and paid for private projects.

---

## Open Source -> Open Government
Maintaining public visibility into a municipal project not only allows one to use GitHub for free...  

Open access also promotes transparency, citizen engagement, and trust in government, ideals of the [Open Government](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1shCAfXCGFKm4Jx8MalzzznV5UsQiAjD2ULBg2Qtduxc/edit?usp=sharing) movement.

# Wikis

---

## Concept
A wiki is a collaborative knowledge base - a set of documents, co-written by multiple authors, published online.

Wikipedia is undoubtedly the world's largest and most popular wiki.  There are other many companies that make wiki software, besides GitHub and Wikipedia/MediaWiki.

Check out an [example wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/croton-on-hudson/github-training-workshop/wiki).

---

## Emphasis on speed
Wikis are intended to be faster and simpler to work with than other web publishing tools.

"wiki" definition from [Hawaiian->English dictionary](https://glosbe.com/haw/en/wiki):

> verb
>
> to be swift, speedy, quick

---

## Advantages
A wiki is a great tool for documenting collective knowledge:
- **web publishing** - easy to publish online
- **multiple authors** - anyone can edit (if given permission)
- **accountability** - it's easy to see who changed what
- **accessibility** - available anywhere, anytime, to anyone
- **centralized knowledge base** - serves as a central repository of knowledge (unlike myriad easy-to-lose Google Docs and emails)

Imagine if Wikipedia was a set of public Google Docs instead of a wiki.

---

## Disadvantages
A wiki has its own limitations for knowledge management:
- **learning curve** - there's a small learning curve to using them effectively
- **images** - adding images to a wiki takes more work than simply dragging-and-dropping
- **potential messiness** - with multiple authors, there is a risk of inconsistent styles (true of any type of shared document)
- **content maintenance** keeping content up-to-date requires effort (true of any type of long-living doc)

# Markdown

---

name: markdown-concept

## Concept
Wiki documents on GitHub are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

Markdown is a simple, standardized way to write documents, including formatting like...
- document headings and sub-headings
- bullet-pointed or numbered lists
- links to other documents

Markdown is easy and very widely used for web publishing of simple documents.

---

## Example

The [previous slide](#markdown-concept) (and all other slides here) was **quickly** written in Markdown:
```markdown
## Concept
Wiki documents are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

Markdown is a simple way to write well-formatted documents, including things like...
- document headings and subheadings
- bullet-pointed or numbered lists
- links to other documents

Markdown is easy and very widely used for web publishing of simple documents.
```

---

## Headings and Sub-Headings

Writing this code in Markdown ...
```markdown
# Some Kind of Heading
```

... when published, becomes:

# Some Kind of Heading

While this code:
```markdown
## A sub-heading
```

... becomes:

## A sub-heading

---

## Bold and Italicized Text

This code:
```markdown
It's a **wonderful** evening!
```

... becomes:

It's a **wonderful** evening!

While this code:
```markdown
It's a _wonderful_ evening!
```
... becomes:

It's a _wonderful_ evening!

---

## Bullet Point Lists

This code:
```markdown
- first item
- second item
- third item
```

... becomes:

- first item
- second item
- third item

---

## Numbered Lists

This code:
```markdown
1. first item
2. second item
3. third item
```

... becomes:

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

---

## Links

This code:
```markdown
[Click me to go to the New York Times](http://nytimes.com)
```

... becomes:

[Click me to go to the New York Times](http://nytimes.com)

---

## Quotes

This code:
```markdown
A quote from Edward Lear's "The Jumblies":
> They went to sea in a Sieve, they did,
> In a Sieve they went to sea:
> In spite of all their friends could say,
> On a winter’s morn, on a stormy day,
> In a Sieve they went to sea!
```

... becomes:

---

## Images

This code:
```markdown
![Sigmund Freud](https://croton-on-hudson.github.io/bicycle-pedestrian-committee/images/presentations/github_training/sigmund_freud.jpg)
```

... becomes:
![Sigmund Freud](https://croton-on-hudson.github.io/bicycle-pedestrian-committee/images/presentations/github_training/sigmund_freud.jpg)

---

## That's all!

Now you pretty much know Markdown.  

You are ready to publish web pages using a wiki.

# Task Boards

---

## Concept
Task boards are used to keep track of the status of each task necessary for a project to be completed.

Many companies offer similar task board software to GitHub, including [Trello](https://trello.com/) and [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).

Check out an [example task board on GitHub](https://github.com/croton-on-hudson/github-training-workshop/projects/1).

![GitHub layout](../images/presentations/github_training/github_layout.png)

---

## Status
On a simple task board, every task is placed in one of a few columns:
1. To do
2. In progress
3. Done

---

## Example
For example, here is a simple [task board for this workshop](https://github.com/croton-on-hudson/github-training-workshop/projects/1).  It's very clear what is already done, and what is left to do.

![task board concept](../images/presentations/github_training/task_board_concept.png)


---

name: label-tasks

## Tagging tasks
Each task can be given a custom label.  This makes it easy to find all tasks with a common label.

![task labels](../images/presentations/github_training/task_board_concept_labels.png)

Note that in order to labels to a task, you must first:
1. click the "..." icon in the top-right of the task and click "Convert to issue"
2. click on the task name to add labels and other task details

---

## Assigning responsibility
Each task can be assigned to a particular individual.  This way everyone knows who is supposed to do what and whether they finished it or not.

![task labels](../images/presentations/github_training/task_board_concept_assignment.png)

---

## Filtering tasks
It's easy to show only tasks with a particular label, or only tasks assigned to a particular individual.  This becomes especially helpful when there are many tasks on the board.

![filter tasks](../images/presentations/github_training/task_board_concept_filter.png)

---

## Changing status
When a task's status changes, simply drag-and-drop it to a new column.

![filter tasks](../images/presentations/github_training/task_board_concept_drag.png)

---

## Maintenance
Keeping the status and details of tasks up-to-date is the big challenge of project management.
- Someone has to regularly update the task board or it becomes useless
- Ideally everyone would be responsible for updating their own tasks
- In reality, there need to be at least a few people who can do this

# Document Storage and Archiving

---

## Concept
GitHub can store files of any kind.
- Documents
- Images
- Videos
- Maps
- ... and more

All changes to files are recorded and old versions are automatically archived.

Check out an [example file storage area on GitHub](https://github.com/croton-on-hudson/github-training-workshop).

![GitHub layout](../images/presentations/github_training/github_layout.png)

---

## Images and other media
Images of any type can be easily stored in GitHub.  The same is true of videos and audio files.

This can be useful for documenting known street issues, or for saving inspirational photos of other municipalities.

![Eliot Way sharrows](https://croton-on-hudson.github.io/bicycle-pedestrian-committee/images/presentations/github_training/eliott_way_sharrows.jpg)

---

## Maps
GitHub provides special support for a common type of map file called GeoJSON.

For example, the Bicycle Pedestrian Committee recently shared with the village [a GeoJSON map showing suggested placement of speed humps and sharrows along Eliott Way](https://github.com/croton-on-hudson/bicycle-pedestrian-committee/blob/master/maps/eliott_way.geojson).

![Eliot Way map](https://croton-on-hudson.github.io/bicycle-pedestrian-committee/images/presentations/github_training/eliott_way_map.png)

---

## Computer Programming Code Files
GitHub is especially good at storing and archiving files with computer programming code.

You may think this is irrelevant to a municipality... but not if you write [lots of code to automatically analyze responses to a survey of 561 local residents](https://github.com/croton-on-hudson/bicycle-pedestrian-committee/tree/master/survey/analysis)!

# Going To The Next Level

---

## Concept
Once you use GitHub frequently, you will eventually wish you could edit wiki documents and manage your files offline on your own computer, rather than do everything online through the GitHub web site.

Of course this is possible.

---

## GitHub Desktop
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is an application you can download onto your own computer to allow you to sync files between your GitHub account and your own computer.

It takes some getting used to.  Recommended only once you're already comfortable with the basics we've covered.
