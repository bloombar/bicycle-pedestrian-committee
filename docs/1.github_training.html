# Overview

---

## Overview
GitHub.com is a web-based suite of project management tools, recently acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion.  

Its primary audience is software developers.

---

## Pricing
GitHub is free to use for public "open source" projects, and paid for private projects.

---

## Open Source -> Open Government
Maintaining public visibility into a municipal project not only allows one to use GitHub for free...  

Open access also promotes transparency, citizen engagement, and trust in government, ideals of the [Open Government](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1shCAfXCGFKm4Jx8MalzzznV5UsQiAjD2ULBg2Qtduxc/edit?usp=sharing) movement.

---

## Features
GitHub includes several features that are of general use to projects of any type:
- [Wikis](#wikis)
- [Task boards](#task-boards)
- [Document archiving](#archiving)

# Wikis

---

## Concept
A wiki is a collaborative knowledge base, published online.

---

## Emphasis on speed
Wikis are intended to be faster and simpler to work with than other web publishing tools.

"wiki" definition from [Hawaiian->English dictionary](https://glosbe.com/haw/en/wiki):
> verb
>
> to be swift, speedy, quick

---

## Advantages
A wiki is the perfect tool for documenting collective knowledge:
- easy to publish online
- anyone can edit (if given permission)
- accessible anywhere, anytime, to anyone
- serves as a central repository of knowledge (unlike myriad Google Docs and emails)

---

## Markdown
Wiki documents are written in plain text, with [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) syntax used to add formatting (headings, bold text, italics, etc) and links to other web pages.

This slide was quickly written in Markdown.

# Task Boards

---

## Concept
Task boards are used to keep track of the status of each task necessary for a project to be completed.

---

## Status
At its simplest, each task is marked as being...
- to do
- in progress
- done
