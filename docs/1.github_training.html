# Overview

---

## Overview
GitHub.com is a web-based suite of project management tools, recently acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion.  

Its primary audience is software developers.

---

## Pricing
GitHub is free to use for public "open source" projects, and paid for private projects.

---

## Open Source -> Open Government
Maintaining public visibility into a municipal project not only allows one to use GitHub for free...  

Open access also promotes transparency, citizen engagement, and trust in government, ideals of the [Open Government](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1shCAfXCGFKm4Jx8MalzzznV5UsQiAjD2ULBg2Qtduxc/edit?usp=sharing) movement.

---

## Features
GitHub includes several features that are of general use to projects of any type:
- [Wikis](#wikis)
- [Task boards](#task-boards)
- [Document archiving](#archiving)

# Wikis

---

## Concept
A wiki is a collaborative knowledge base, published online.

---

## Emphasis on speed
Wikis are intended to be faster and simpler to work with than other web publishing tools.


"wiki" definition from [Hawaiian->English dictionary](https://glosbe.com/haw/en/wiki):
> verb
>
> to be swift, speedy, quick

---

## Advantages
A wiki is the perfect tool for documenting collective knowledge:
- easy to publish online
- anyone can edit (if given permission)
- accessible anywhere, anytime, to anyone
- serves as a central repository of knowledge (unlike myriad Google Docs and emails)

---

## Markdown
Wiki documents are written in plain text, with [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) syntax used to add formatting (headings, bold text, italics, etc) and links to other web pages.

This slide was quickly written in Markdown.

# Task Boards

---

## Concept
Task boards are used to keep track of the status of each task necessary for a project to be completed.

---

## Status
A task board is divided into three columns, with each task placed in one of the columns:
1. To do
2. In progress
3. Done

---

## Example
For example, a simple [task board for this workshop](https://github.com/croton-on-hudson/bicycle-pedestrian-committee/projects/3):

![task board concept](../images/presentations/github_training/task_board_concept.png)

It's very clear what is done, and what is left to do.

---

## Tagging tasks
Each task can be given a custom label.

![task labels](../images/presentations/github_training/task_board_concept_labels.png)

This makes it easy to find all tasks with a common label.

# Document Archiving

---

## Concept
GitHub can store files of any kind.

All changes to files are recorded and old versions are automatically archived.

---

## Images and other media
Images of any type can be easily stored in GitHub.  The same is true of videos and audio files.

This can be useful for documenting known street issues, and inspirational photos of other municipalities.

---

## Maps
GitHub provides special support for a common type of map file called GeoJSON.

For example, the Bicycle Pedestrian Committee recently shared with the village [a GeoJSON map showing suggested placement of speed humps and sharrows along Elliott Way](https://github.com/croton-on-hudson/bicycle-pedestrian-committee/blob/master/maps/eliott_way.geojson).


---

## Computer Programming Code Files
GitHub is especially good at storing and archiving files with computer programming code.

You may think this is irrelevant... but not if you write [code to automatically analyze a survey of 561 local residents](https://github.com/croton-on-hudson/bicycle-pedestrian-committee/tree/master/survey)!
