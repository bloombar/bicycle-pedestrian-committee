# Overview

## Overview
GitHub.com is a web-based suite of project management tools, recently acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion.  Its primary audience is software developers.

---

## Pricing
GitHub is free to use for public "open source" projects, and paid for private projects.

---

## Open Source -> Open Government
Maintaining public visibility into a municipal project not only allows one to use GitHub for free...  it also promotes transparency, citizen engagement, and trust in government, ideals of the Open Government movement.

---

## Features
GitHub includes several features that are of general use to projects of any type:
- Wikis
- Task boards
- Document archiving
