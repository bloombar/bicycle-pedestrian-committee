# COMPLETE STREETS POLICY RESOLUTION

**WHEREAS**, streets are the main arteries of a community, moving people, goods, and services from one place to another; and

**WHEREAS**, "Complete Streets" are those streets that incorporate safe and conveneint access and mobility for all current and projected users of all ages, including pedestrians, bicyclists, scooters and skateboarders, persons with disabilities, motorists, movers of commercial goods, users and operators of public transportation, emergency vehicles, children, seniors, and families; and

**WHEREAS**, Complete Streets that support and invite multiple uses contribute to a higher quality of life, a healthier local economy, a more sustainable environmental impact, and a more vibrant public life than streets designed primarily to move automobiles and trucks with little thought or effort put into other uses; and

**WHEREAS**, many studies show that when roads are better designed for bicycling, walking, and public transit use, more people do so; and

**WHEREAS**, promoting and supporting walking, bicycling, and public transit as alternatives to the automobile reduces negative environmental impacts, helps residents achieve the well-known health benefits of active transportation, and reduces costs to the commuter; and

**WHEREAS**, Complete Streets design features recognize that the needs of users vary according to context and they may include, but are not limited to, well-maintained and connected sidewalks, paved shoulders suitable for cycling, lane striping, bike lanes, share-the-road signage, well-maintained and clearly marked crosswalks, curb extensions, road diets, pedestrian control signalization, bus pull outs, curb cuts, raised crosswalks and ramps, traffic calming measures, street trees, landscaping, and street furniture; and

**WHEREAS**, local focus on Complete Streets is compatible with New York State's Complete Streets law, which requires that Complete Streets Design Features be considered for the planning, design, construction, and reconstruction of roadways receiving federal and state funding; and

**WHEREAS**, over 40 other municipalities in New York State, 27 other States (as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia) and at least 495 regional and local jurisdictions now have Complete Streets policies; and

**WHEREAS**, Complete Streets enhance safe walking and bicycling options for school-age children, in recognition of the objectives of the National Safe Routes to School Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Physical Activity Guidelines; and

**WHEREAS**, Complete Streets are supported by the Institute of Traffic Engineers, American Planning Association, American Association of Retired Persons, and many other transportation, planning, and public health professionals and organizations; and

**WHEREAS**, the implementation of Complete Streets will help the Village of Croton-on-Hudson to achieve its goals as a Climate Smart Community; and

**WHEREAS**, the Federal Department of Transportation encourages States, local governments, professional associations, community organizations, public transportation agencies, and other government agencies, to adopt policy statements expressing their commitment to accommodating bicyclists and pedestrians as an integral element of the transportation system [Ref: [United States Department of Transportation Policy Statement on Bicycle and Pedestrian Accommodation](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bicycle_pedestrian/guidance/policy_accom.cfm), May 11, 2010],

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:** that the Village of Croton-on-Hudson Board of Trustees does hereby establish a Complete Streets Policy; and

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED:** that the Village, where doing so would not have an adverse impact on public safety and where the cost would not be disproportionate to the need, shall consider Complete Streets in the planning, design, construction, reconstruction, and rehabilitation (not including resurfacing, maintenance, or pavement recycling) of transportation infrastructure projects and when considering new development within the Village of Croton-on-Hudson by taking into consideration the features set forth in the Design Features for Complete Streets (the "Design Features") attached hereto as [Appendix A](#Appendix-A); and

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED:** that, at a minimum, pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit improvements shall be considered in the design of the following specific activities:

1. Traffic impact studies.
1. Analyses of proposed street changes.
1. Construction of any new public or private road, bridge, or right-of-way.
1. Re-construction or widening of roads.
1. Land development or re-development projects, as determined applicable/appropriate by the Village of Croton-on-Hudson Planning Board.

# COMPLETE STREETS POLICY

## Purpose and Intent

**A**. The Village of Croton-on-Hudson seeks to enhance the safety, access, convenience, and comfort of all users of all ages and abilities, including pedestrians, people requiring mobility aids, bicyclists, scooters and skateboarders, transit users, motorists, and freight drivers. This can be accomplished through the design, operation, and maintenance of the Village's transportation network so as to create a connected network of facilities that accommodate each mode of travel, consistent with and supportive of the local community, and recognizing that all streets are different and that the needs of various users will need to be balanced in a flexible manner.

## Bicycle, Pedestrian, and/or Transit Improvements

**A**. For the purposes of this Policy, the term "bicycle, pedestrian, and transit improvements" includes those facilities and amenities that are recognized as contributing to Complete Streets, which may include, but are not limited to, street and sidewalk lighting; sidewalks and pedestrian safety improvements; median refuges; crosswalks; improvements that provide ADA (Americanas With Disabilities Act) compliant accessibility; transit accommodations, including improved pedestrian access to transit stops and bus shelters; bicycle accommodations, including bicycle storage, bicycle parking, bicycle routes, shared-use lanes, enhanced shoulders or bike lanes; street trees; landscaping; signage; street furniture; and adequate drainage facilities.

## Applicability

**A**. The Village shall consider Complete Streets and Sustainable Complete Streets and associated practices when planning roadway projects, including design, planning, reconstruction, rehabilitiation, and maintenance, and when considering new development within the Village of Croton-on-Hudson by taking into consideration the features set forth in the Design Features for Complete Streets (the "Design Features") attached hereto as [Appendix A](#Appendix-A).

**B**. The design of new or reconstructed facilities shall anticipate the likely future demand of bicycling, walking, and transit facilities, and should not preclude the provision of future improvements. [For example, under most circumstances, bridges (which last for 75 years or more) should be built with sufficient width for safe bicycle and pedestrian ues in anticipation of a future need for such facilities].

**C**. Specifically, bicycle, pedestrian, and transit improvements shall be considered in the design of the following activities, except as provided under subsection D below.

1. Construction of any new public or private road, bridge, or right-of-way.
1. Paving, re-paving, re-construction, or widening of roads.
1. Land development or re-development projects, as determined applicable/appropriate by the Village of Croton-on-Hudson Planning Board.

**D**. Bicycle, pedestrian, and/or transit facilities may not be warranted under one or more of the following conditions:

1. A project involving only ordinary maintenance activities designed to keep assets in serviceable condition, such as emergency road repair, mowing, cleaning, sweeping, spot repair, concrete joint repair, pothole filling, or when interim measures are implemented on temporary detour or haul routes.
1. The approving agency, in consultation with the Village Engineer, where it deems necessary, determines there is insufficient space to safely accommodate new facilities.
1. The approving agency, in consultation with the Village Engineer, where it deems necessary, determines there are relatively high safety risks.
1. The approving agency, in consultation with the Village Engineer, where it deems necessary, exempts a project due to the excessive and disproportionate cost of bicycle, pedestrian, and/or transit facilities as part of a project.
1. The approving agency, in consultation with the Village Engineer, where it deems necessary, determines that the construction is not practically feasible or cost effective.

This Policy shall become effective as of October 1, 2020.
