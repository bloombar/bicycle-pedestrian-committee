# COMPLETE STREETS POLICY RESOLUTION

**WHEREAS**, streets are the main arteries of a community, moving people, goods, and services from one place to another; and

**WHEREAS**, "Complete Streets" are those streets that incorporate safe and conveneint access and mobility for all current and projected users of all ages, including pedestrians, bicyclists, scooters and skateboarders, persons with disabilities, motorists, movers of commercial goods, users and operators of public transportation, emergency vehicles, children, seniors, and families; and

**WHEREAS**, the Village of Croton-on-Hudson acknowledges that streets that support and invite multiple uses contribute to a higher quality of life, a healthier local economy, a more sustainable environmental impact, and a more vibrant public life than streets designed primarily to move automobiles and trucks with little thought or effort put into other users; and

**WHEREAS**, the Village of Croton-on-Hudson acknowledges that promoting and supporting walking, bicycling, and public transit as alternatives to the automobile reduces negative environmental impacts, helps residents achieve the well-known health benefits of active transportation, and reduces costs to the commuter; and

**WHEREAS**, many studies show that when roads are better designed for bicycling, walking, and public transit use, more people do so; and

**WHEREAS**, Complete Streets design features recognize that the needs of users vary according to context and they may include, but are not limited to, well-maintained and connected sidewalks, paved shoulders suitable for cycling, lane striping, bike lanes, share-the-road signage, well-maintained and clearly marked crosswalks, curb extensions, road diets, pedestrian control signalization, bus pull outs, curb cuts, raised crosswalks and ramps, traffic calming measures, street trees, landscaping, and street furniture; and

**WHEREAS**, local focus on Complete Streets is compatible with New York State's Complete Streets Act ([Chapter 398, Laws of New York](http://open.nysenate.gov/legislation/bill/s5411a-2011)), signed into law on August 15, 2011, which requires that Complete Streets Design Features be considered for the planning, design, construction, and reconstruction of roadways receiving federal and state funding; and

**WHEREAS**, over 40 other municipalities in New York State, 27 other States (as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia) and at least 495 regional and local jurisdictions now have Complete Streets policies; and

**WHEREAS**, Complete Streets enhance safe walking and bicycling options for school-age children, in recognition of the objectives of the National Safe Routes to School Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Physical Activity Guidelines; and

**WHEREAS**, Complete Streets are supported by the Institute of Traffic Engineers, American Planning Association, American Association of Retired Persons, American Heart Association, and many other transportation, planning, and public health professionals and organizations; and

**WHEREAS**, the implementation of Complete Streets will help the Village of Croton-on-Hudson continue its goal of becoming a Climate Smart Community under the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation program of that name; and

**WHEREAS**, the Federal Department of Transportation encourages States, local governments, professional associations, community organizations, public transportation agencies, and other government agencies, to adopt policy statements expressing their commitment to accommodating bicyclists and pedestrians as an integral element of the transportation system [Ref: [United States Department of Transportation Policy Statement on Bicycle and Pedestrian Accommodation](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bicycle_pedestrian/guidance/policy_accom.cfm), May 11, 2010]; and

**WHEREAS**, the Village of Croton-on-Hudson therefore, in light of the foregoing benefits and considerations, wishes to strengthen its commitment to Complete Streets and desires that its streets form a comprehensive and integrated transportation network promoting safe, equitable, and convenient travel for all users while preserving flexibility, recognizing community context, and using the latest and best design guidelines and standards.

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:** by the Village Board that the Village of Croton-on-Hudson adopts the Complete Streets Policy attached hereto as [Exhibit A](#EXHIBIT-A), and made part of this resolution.

## CROTON-ON-HUDSON COMPLETE STREETS POLICY

### A. Complete Streets Principles

1. **Complete Streets Serving All Users.** The Village of Croton-on-Hudson ("The Village") expresses its commitment to creating and maintaining Complete Streets that provide safe, comfortable, and convenient travel along and across streets (including streets, roads, highways, bridges, and other portions of the transportation system to the extent that they are controlled by The Village) through a comprehensive, integrated transportation network that serves all categories of users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, persons with disabilities, scooters and skateboarders, motorists, movers of commercial goods, users and operators of public transportation, emergency vehicles, seniors, children, youth, and families.

1. **Context Sensitivity.** In planning and implementing street projects, all departments of The Village shall maintain sensitivity to local conditions in both residential and business districts and shall work with residents, merchants, and other stakeholders to ensure that a strong sense of place ensues. Improvements that will be considered shall include sidewalks, shared use paths, bicycle lanes, bicycle routes, paved shoulders, street trees, landscaping, planting strips, accessible curb ramps, crosswalks, pedestrian refuge islands, pedestrian signals, signs, street furniture, bicycle parking facilities, public transit stops and facilities, transit priority signalization, and other features assisting in the provision of safe travel for all users, such as traffic calming circles and other traffic calming devices, curb bulb outs / curb extensions, road diets, and those features identified in the Croton-on-Hudson Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee's Master Plan and Protect, Improve, Expand (PIE) Plan. A checklist of common Complete Streets design features that can be evaluated for inclusion in each opportunity to improve streets and the transportation network is set forth in the Design Features for Complete Streets attached hereto as [Exhibit B](#Exhibit-B) for reference.

1) **Complete Streets Routinely Addressed by All Departments**. All relevant Departments of The Village shall work towards making Complete Streets practices a routine part of everyday operations; approach every relevant project, program, and practice as an opportunity to improve streets and the transportation network for all categories of users; and work in coordination with other departments, agencies, and jurisdictions to maximize opportunities for Complete Streets connectivity and cooperation. The following example project types provide opportunities: pavement resurfacing, restriping, curb repairs, accessing above and underground utilities, signalization operations or modifications, and maintenance of landscaping and related features. In order to ensure coordination and compliance with this Complete Streets Policy across all Departments and Divisions, The Village shall develop internal practices that guide routine staff actions and decisions. These practices shall be developed and updated by the Department of Public Works (DPW) in partnership with the Engineering Department and other relevant Village Departments and Divisions. The Director of Public Works shall identify one or more Complete Streets policy coordinator(s) within the Highway division or at the Department level to oversee implementation of and future updates to this Policy.

1) **All Projects and Phases.** Complete Streets infrastructure sufficient to enable reasonably safe travel along and across the right of way for each category of users shall be incorporated into all planning, funding, design, approval, and implementation processes for any construction, reconstruction, retrofit, maintenance, operations, alteration, or repair of streets (including streets, roads, highways, bridges, and other portions of the transportation system), except that specific infrastructure for a given category of users may be exclued if an exemption is approved via the process set forth in Section C.1 of this Policy. In order to plan, fund, design, and implement projects in compliance with this Policy, project delivery staff shall be required to attend a Complete Streets training, which shall include the following components: Village of Croton-on-Hudson Complete Streets Policy; Village internal practices to implement the Policy; overview of Complete Streets design principles; application of pedestsrian and bicycle design guidelines, including but not limited to those listed in Section B.2. The required training shall be identified by the Department Director and be coordinated by the Complete Streets policy coordinator(s).

### B. Implementation

1. **Plan Consultation and Consistency.** Maintenance, planning, and design of projects affecting the transportation system shall be consistent with local bicycle, pedestrian, transit, multimodal, and other relevant plans, except wheree such consistency cannot be achieved without negative consequences, and if the head of the relevant departments provides written approval explaining the basis of such exemption. Such exemptions shall be presented to the Board of Trustees and the Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee early in the planning and design stage, to ensure an opportunity to provide comments and recommendations.

1. **Design.** The Village will generally follow its own adopted design standards and will also evaluate using the latest design standards and innovative design options, with a goal of balancing user needs. The Village shall continue to develop and regularly update and adhere to a set of roadway design guidelines that compiles guidance from adopted plans, design manuals, and local and national best practices, covering but not limited to the following topics: bikeway design; pedestrian design; traffic calming; roadway geometery; signal operations; and other topics as deemed appropriate by the Engineering Department Directors. Wherever possible, specific dimensional design details, cross-sections and plan views shall be provided for each of these elements.

1. **Street Network/Connectivity.** As feasible, The Village shall incorporate Complete Streets infrastructure into existing streets to improve the safety and convenience of all users and to create employment, with the particular goal of creating a connected network of facilities accommodating each category of users, and increasing connectivity across jurisdictional boundaries and for existing and anticipated future areas of travel origination or destination.

1. **Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee Consultation.** Transportation projects shall be reviewed by the Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee early in the planning and design stage, to provide the committee an opportunity to provide comments and recommendations regarding Complete Streets features to be incorporated into the project.

1. **Evaluation.** All relevant Departments and Divisions shall perform annual programmatic evaluations of how well the streets and transportation network of The Village are serving each category of users by collecting baseline data and collecting follow-up data on a regular basis. The Complete Streets policy coordinator(s) shall develop appropriate performance metrics and annually assess the need to update them. These performance metrics shall be developed and updated in partnership with the DPW and Engineering Department staff and other relevant Departments and Divisions as well as outside agencies.

### C. Exemptions

1. **Leadership Approval for Exemptions.** Projects that seek exemption from the Complete Streets Policy must provide written finding of why accommodations for all modes were not included in the project, and must receive written approval by the Engineering Department Director or their designated representative. Projects that are granted exceptions must be made publicly available for review. Subsequent to each project review described in Sections B.1 and B.2 of this Policy, the Engineering Department Director shall report on exemptions from this Policy or from adopted Plans to the Village Manager in order that the Village Manager can report to and make appropriate recommendations to the Village Board. Annually, the Engineering Department Director shall make a report to the Village Manager and the Village Board describing and explaining the previous year's exemptions as part of an annual Complete Streets Policy Implementation Report.

1. Basesd on the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) exemption policy, exemptions to The Village's Complete Streets Policy may be granted if one of the following criteria is met:

   a. Bicyclists and pedestrians are prohibited by law from using the roadway.

   b. The cost of establishing bikeways or walkways would be excessively disproportionate to the need or probably use. In unusual circumstances, such as where natural features (e.g. steep hillsides, shorelines) make it very costly or impossible to accommodate all modes, "excessively disproportionate" is defined as exceeding twenty percent of the cost of the larger transportation project.

   c. Where sparsity of population or other factors suggests an absence of need. For example, all construction or reconstruction of public streets must include sidewalk improvements on both sides, unless the street is a cul-de-sac with few dwellings or the street has severe topographic or natural resource constraints.

   d. Transit accommodations are not rqeuired where there is no existing or planned transit service.

   e. Routine maintenance of the transportation network that does not change the roadway geometry, such as mowing, sweeping, spot repair, concrete joint repair, pothole filling, or when interim measures are implemented on temporary detour or haul routes.

   f. Where a reasonable and equivalent project along the same corridor is already programmed to provide facilities exempted from the project at hand.
